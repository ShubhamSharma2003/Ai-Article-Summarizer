The project's frontend is built using Tailwind CSS, a popular utility-first CSS framework that allows for rapid development and customization. Tailwind CSS provides a clean and modern look, ensuring a user-friendly experience.

On the backend, the Redux Toolkit Query library is leveraged to manage the API requests and responses seamlessly. Redux Toolkit Query simplifies the data fetching and caching process, providing an efficient and reliable way to communicate with the OpenAI API.
